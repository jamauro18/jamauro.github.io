        <p>It was 1908 when they first laid eyes on eachother, and right from the beginning, it was love at first sight. 
          Back in 1908, while the dinosaurs were still alive, this was a very taboo occurance two men such as Dan and Stefano
        to fall so madly in love. Some people say it was a miracle they were even still alive, since the dinosaurs were drawn to
        their sexiness. Somehow the pair survived into their 40's, long enough to meet each other and fall in love! Now i know this story
        might sounds a little farfetched but this is only the beginning of the tale.</p>
