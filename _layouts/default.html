        <p>It was 1908 when 40-year-old Daniel and 42-year-old Stefano first laid eyes on eachother, and right from the beginning, it was love at first sight. 
          Back in 1908, while the dinosaurs were still alive, this was a very taboo occurrence that two men, such as Dan and Stefano,
        fell so madly in love. Some people say it was a miracle that they were even still alive, since the dinosaurs were drawn to
        their sexiness. Somehow, the pair survived this threat and made it into their 40's, long enough to meet each other and fall in 
        love! Now I know this story might sound a little far-fetched but this is only the beginning of their "fairy"tale.</p>
